# Ping Pong Game

## Overview

A Python implementation of the classic Ping Pong game using the Turtle module. This is a dual-player game where each player controls a paddle to prevent the ball from passing them. The game provides a fun and interactive experience by challenging players to keep the ball in play as long as possible.

## Project Outline

- The game consists of two paddles and a ball that moves randomly in all directions.
